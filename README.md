# Reducing-sum-of-submatrices
This is my approach for a question asked in some coding contest, the problem is as follows

MINIMIZE THE SUM

You are given a matrix NxM having non negative integers and a non negative integer K.
You are allowed to do the following operation at most K times:
  You can reduce the value of any element of the matrix by 1.
  You cannot reduce an element to a negative value.
  
"Find the minimum possile sum of the sum of all elements in each submatrix after performing at most K decrements."
